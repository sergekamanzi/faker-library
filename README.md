# Household Energy Usage Dataset (Synthetic)

This project generates a **synthetic dataset** of household energy usage in Rwanda using the [Faker](https://pypi.org/project/Faker/) library and Python.  
The dataset is designed for **machine learning, data analysis, and energy consumption insights**.

---

##  Features

- **11,000 household records** with structured data.  
- Appliances commonly found in Rwandan homes (e.g., *Iron, Laptop, Blender, LED Lamp, TV*).  
- Realistic **power consumption (Watts)** per appliance type.  
- **Monthly energy usage (kWh)** computed from power, usage hours, and quantity.  
- **Estimated bills (Frw)** calculated using Rwanda’s 2025 tariff brackets:
  - `0–20 kWh → 89 Frw per kWh`
  - `21–50 kWh → 310 Frw per kWh`
  - `50+ kWh → 369 Frw per kWh`
- Income level distribution: *Low (35%), Medium (50%), High (15%)*.  
- Regional diversity: *Kigali, Huye, Musanze, Rubavu, Nyagatare, Rusizi, Muhanga*.
